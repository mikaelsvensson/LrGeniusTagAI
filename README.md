# LrGeniusTagAI

[![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/W7X2240HF4)

A Lightroom Classic plugin that uses AI vision models to automatically generate
**titles, captions, alt text, and keywords** for your photos — directly inside
Lightroom, on the Library grid or during export.

## Features

- **Batch analysis** — select any number of photos in the Library grid (or run it
  as an export action) and let an AI model describe them all in one pass.
- **Multiple AI providers** — choose per-install which model does the work:
  - Google Gemini (Flash Lite, Flash, Pro) via the Gemini API
  - OpenAI ChatGPT (Nano, Mini, standard) via the OpenAI API
  - [Ollama](https://ollama.com) — run a local vision model, no cloud/API key needed
  - [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai) — run a local vision model, no cloud/API key needed
- **Configurable output** — independently enable/disable generation of title,
  caption, alt text (for accessibility), and keywords.
- **Keyword hierarchy** — optionally sort generated keywords into categories
  (Activities, Buildings, Location, Objects, People, Moods, Sceneries, Animals,
  Vehicles, ...) and/or nest them under a top-level keyword per provider
  (e.g. "Google Gemini").
- **Custom prompts** — edit the system prompt/instructions and save multiple
  named prompt presets to switch between.
- **Multi-language output** — generate results in English, German, French,
  Spanish, or Italian.
- **Context-aware** — optionally submit existing GPS coordinates, keywords,
  folder names, or collection names to the AI as extra context, or add
  free-text photo context per-batch via a dialog before analysis.
- **Review before save** — optional validation dialog lets you approve, edit,
  or reject AI-generated results before they're written to the catalog.
- **Folder stacks** — optionally analyze one photo per Lightroom folder stack
  and copy the saved title, caption, alt text, and keywords to every stack
  member (including unselected and collapsed members). Off by default.
- **Preflight & cost estimate** — an optional preflight dialog shows what will
  be sent before a batch runs, and a running token/cost estimate is shown
  afterwards (Gemini/ChatGPT pricing tables included; no warranty on accuracy).
- **Debug & performance logging** — built-in log file plus optional per-photo
  CSV performance logging (model, duration, settings) for tuning your setup.
- **Update checks** — optional periodic check for new plugin releases, or check
  manually from the plugin settings.

## How it works

1. The plugin exports a temporary, resized JPEG copy of each selected photo
   (configurable long-edge size and quality — smaller/lower-quality exports
   cost less and process faster). If the apply-to-stack option is enabled, later
   selected photos that share a stack with one already analyzed in this
   run are skipped (no extra export or API call).
2. The image (plus any opted-in metadata like GPS/keywords/folder name/collection names) is
   sent to the configured AI provider's vision API along with your prompt.
3. The AI's structured response is parsed into title/caption/alt text/keywords.
4. After optional review, the results are written back to the photo's
   Lightroom metadata, and the temp export file is deleted. With the stack
   option on, the same saved fields are also written to the other members of
   that stack.

## Requirements

- Adobe Lightroom Classic (SDK 11.0+, i.e. Lightroom Classic 11 / 2022 or later)
- One of:
  - a Google AI Studio API key (for Gemini models)
  - an OpenAI API key (for ChatGPT models)
  - a local [Ollama](https://ollama.com) or [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai)
    install running a vision-capable model

## Installation

1. Download `LrGeniusTagAI.lrdevplugin` from the
   [Releases](https://github.com/LrGenius/LrGeniusTagAI/releases) page (or clone this repository).
2. In Lightroom Classic, go to **File → Plug-in Manager**, click **Add**, and
   select the `LrGeniusTagAI.lrdevplugin` folder.
3. Open the plugin's settings (still in the Plug-in Manager) to configure your
   AI provider and API key(s) — see [Configuration](#configuration) below.

## Configuration

All settings live under **File → Plug-in Manager → LrGeniusTagAI**:

- **AI model** — pick the provider/model to use; local Ollama/LM Studio models
  are auto-discovered if those services are running.
- **API keys** — enter your Gemini and/or ChatGPT API key, or set the base URL
  for a local Ollama/LM Studio server (defaults to `localhost:11434` /
  `localhost:1234`).
- **Prompts** — edit the default system prompt or add/delete named presets.
- **Result language** — choose the output language.
- **Generate** — toggle which fields to generate (caption, alt text, title,
  keywords) and whether to review results before saving.
- **If photo is part of stack, apply results to entire stack** — when enabled,
  analyze the first selected photo in each folder stack and copy the saved
  title, caption, alt text, and keywords to all members of that stack.
  Default off. Does not apply to collection stacks.
- **Submit existing metadata** — opt in to sending GPS, existing keywords,
  folder names, or collection names as extra context to the AI.
- **Keyword hierarchy** — enable/disable categorized keywords and edit the
  category list; optionally nest keywords under a top-level, per-provider
  keyword.
- **Export settings** — long-edge size (px) and JPEG quality used for the
  temporary image sent to the AI.

## Usage

1. Select one or more photos in the Library grid.
2. Run **Library → Plug-in Extras → Analyze photos with AI** (also available
   as an export action).
3. Review the preflight dialog (if enabled), wait for the batch to process,
   and optionally confirm/edit each result in the validation dialog.
4. Generated title/caption/alt text/keywords are written to the catalog.

## Supported AI providers

| Provider   | Models                                              | Requires        |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| Gemini     | 2.5 Flash-Lite/Flash/Pro, 3.1/3.5 Flash-Lite/Flash/Pro| Google API key  |
| ChatGPT    | 5.4 Nano/Mini, 5.4, 5.5                               | OpenAI API key  |
| Ollama     | any locally installed vision model                    | Ollama running locally |
| LM Studio  | any locally installed vision model                    | LM Studio running locally |

Cloud provider usage is billed by the provider according to your own API plan;
local Ollama/LM Studio models are free but require sufficient local hardware.
